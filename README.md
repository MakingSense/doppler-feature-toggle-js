# Doppler Feature Toggle JavaScript Client

JavaScript client of our simple feature toggle system based on a JSON file over HTTP.

I am doing this project as part of [Making Sense's Self Training Program](http://confluence.makingsense.com/display/DD/Training+program).

The objective of this training is refreshing my knowledge on several technologies (TypeScript, Node, ES Modules) but mainly in the way to work with them to create a library (builds, tests, versions, continuous integration, packages, CDN).

See more details in [CAP-215](http://jira.makingsense.com/browse/CAP-215).

## Usage

Nothing useful to use yet.

## Development

### Yarn scripts

- `yarn run test`: Run test suite
- `yarn run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `yarn run test:prod`: Run tests, format validator, linting and generate coverage (not yet)

### Architecture and other decisions

It is based on [TypeScript library starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter), but in place of using it as it is, the project has been created from the scratch and taking different decisions.

Thanks to @joaquinicolas and @matiasbeckerle for sharing some of these links with me.

### Yarn vs NPM

_TypeScript library starter_ was using NPM. It is more advanced than the last version that I used before. For example it has a lock file like Yarn. 

But some experiments gave me some issues in Travis running _npm ci_, so I prefer trying with Yarn.

### Commit messages

I will use [Angular's Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) in order to generate release notes automatically using [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

I like using rebase and merge, without squashing commits, I am not sure if it will work fine with semantic release, let's try.

Thanks to @stirelli for helping me with it.
